#### Link to live site: [Explore NASA](https://explore-nasa.herokuapp.com/)

- Technologies:

    - HTML

Created an informational web application that allows the user to generate various data sets by toggling and clicking buttons.

- APOD image toggle button generates a new data set daily.

- Martian Sunset toggle button that generates 9 random sunset images.

- Lunar transit viewing button. Used multiple functions to generate the lunar transit in order of array index with one click. 

- Rover search: Allows user to view random rover images available per specified rover name input. Each time the input is submitted a new image will appear set randomly to the image array's data set.

#### Future Enchancements
The lunar transit function needs to be refactored to adhere to DRY practices.
I believe that refactoring handleEPICEvent1() will help with the image delay that occurs.
